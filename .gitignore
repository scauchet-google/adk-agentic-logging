#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   usually handled by the user. For a specific project, it can be useful to check them in.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1251, pypa recommends not to commit Pipfile.lock to
#   projects because version numbers may vary across different operating systems.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, if you would rather not, uncomment the line below.
